Phew... 6 hours of teaching in a day... School teachers are endurance incarnate, I swear.

## Relevant to the assignment

* [The `toString` method](http://www.javabeginner.com/learn-java/java-tostring-method): specifically, notice the implicit stringification of variables when printing them, or adding them with other strings. I noticed a lot of students are unnecessarily calling `toString`.
* [Iterators and Iterables](http://blog.dreasgrech.com/2010/03/javas-iterators-and-iterables.html): this may help you simplify parts of your assignment code
* Check out the "Effective Java" link from week 4 for help with implementing `equals` and `hashCode` methods.
