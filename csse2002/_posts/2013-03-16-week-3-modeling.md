title: 'Week 3: Modeling'
---

**Update**: Oops! I made two important mistakes in this code somewhere. I'll mention the corrections as exercises in my classes next week.

Here are my revised [practical solutions](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/csse2002/tree/master/2013S1/week3). I re-implemented the `ThreeWayLamp` class to use enums (mentioned in class), and extended it to have colors to communicate the benefit of enums. I've put in a link to a tutorial on enum types.

You can also see my approaches to the [flight](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/csse2002/blob/gh-pages/solutions/week3/Flight.java) and [unlock pattern](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/csse2002/blob/gh-pages/solutions/week3/Pattern.java) design problems from my tutorials. As mentioned at the top of `Flight.java`, you should definitely not write your comments like I have in these files. Also, as always, post a question on the newsgroup or email me if you have questions.

This week's tutorials went really well. It was great to see the different groups concurrently working on such diverse problems. [Here are the slides](https://docs.google.com/a/minglis.id.au/presentation/d/1VSxTKLhllYiJujUwtjluumhpVKAB0GkDEdXU5Myrzww/present). I reviewed the answers, and it seems many students aren't yet comfortable writing and thinking in Java. We'll get plenty more opportunities to practise this throughout the semester, but you should also devote some spare time to practising it too. It's certainly a skill you'll have to acquire to do well in this course.

See you next week!

* [Java Tutorials on Enum Types](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html): they rock! Any time you see `public static final int`, alarm bells should be going off.
* [Getting on UQ's newsgroups via a dedicated client](http://student.eait.uq.edu.au/infrastructure/newsgroups.html): I've since realized you can also read them via the "myNewsgroups" in [my.UQ](https://my.uq.edu.au/).
* [Price comparisons of the textbook on booko.com.au](http://booko.com.au/9780470128718/Introduction-to-Programming-and-Object-Oriented-Design-Using-Java): there's probably a risk involved with buying from certain retailers, so use your discretion.
* [How to write unmaintainable code](http://thc.org/root/phun/unmaintain.html): take this into your exam and you'll be guaranteed a 7.
* [Type checking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_typing#Type_checking): last week's Wikipedia article on strong typing didn't really explain the difference between Java's and Python's typing systems. I'm sorry I didn't catch that. This article section should provide a better explanation.
* [New Programming Jargon](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/new-programming-jargon.html): we'll cover FDD in the course after we study [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) :)

Here are two great books to learn Java with (but the [Java Tutorials](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) are awesome too):

* [Head First Java](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjava/): chapter 2, on objects, is [free from the website](http://oreilly.com/catalog/hfjava2/chapter/ch02.pdf).
* [Thinking in Java](http://mindview.net/Books/TIJ4): older editions are free, but they're *very* old...
