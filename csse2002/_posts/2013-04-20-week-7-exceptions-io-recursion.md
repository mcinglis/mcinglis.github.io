title: 'Week 7: Exceptions, I/O and Recursion'
---

* [Slides](https://docs.google.com/a/minglis.id.au/presentation/d/1OQZ6uW74bcRnKPqBrOey_z7YEH3WlNKDw-OlxhlD-7s/present)
* [Solutions](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/csse2002/tree/master/2013S1/week7)

Everyone seemed pretty comfortable with recursion, so here's some resources on exceptions and I/O, which we're meant to skip over in tutorials (I don't know why).

* [An Intuitive Explanation of Bayes' Theorem](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=13156): relevant to assignment 1 (but a bit too late).
* [Java Tutorials: Basic I/O](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/): Java 7 brought new input/output interfaces and libraries, and the lectures didn't seem to cover them in much detail.
* [Java Tutorials: Exceptions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/): again, some interesting Java 7 additions to exceptions.
* On Exceptions: read all of chapter 9 in <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=effective+java">Effective Java</a>. Joshua Bloch makes the case for some of the points I mentioned in class today (on the slides).
* [Wikipedia on JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML): if you can help it, use existing languages and formats for handling data.
