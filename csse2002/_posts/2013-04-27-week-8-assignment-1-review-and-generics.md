title: 'Week 8: Assignment 1 Review and Generics'
---

Today, we spoke about common mistakes I noticed while marking assignment 1.

We also spent some time on generics, as they're semi-relevant for assignment 2.

* [Java Tutorials: Generics](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/): the lectures will cover generics in week 11, I think.
