I just released [Macrofun](https://github.com/mcinglis/macrofun): it lets you map, fold and zip with the C preprocessor. I've been working on this for a while. I was going to release it as a fully-fledged library, but then today I thought to check if it actually conformed to the standards. Turns out it doesn't.

So I'm just throwing it out the door now, in case anyone else is interested.

I'm going to move onto other things.
