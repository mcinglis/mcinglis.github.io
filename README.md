These files are transformed by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and served by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) at [minglis.id.au](http://minglis.id.au).

I've gone to some lengths to make it easily configurable - many things can be changed centrally in [\_config.yml](/_config.yml). You're very welcome to use this as a base for your own site.

[Email me](mailto:me@minglis.id.au) or [create an issue](https://github.com/mcinglis/mcinglis.github.io/issues) if you would like to suggest or correct something.
